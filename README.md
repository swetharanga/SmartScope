Smart Scope: Object Detection Model
Project Overview
Smart Scope is an advanced defect detection system designed to identify and classify defects in electronic components using computer vision and deep learning techniques. This project aims to improve quality control processes in manufacturing by automating the detection of defects in PCBs, LEDs, and other electronic components.

Features
High-resolution image capture using USB microscope
Preprocessing pipeline for image standardization and quality control
Deep learning model based on EfficientNetB0 for defect classification
Real-time defect detection and visualization
User-friendly interface for system interaction and result display

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/swetharanga/smart-scope.git
cd smart-scope
Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the USB microscope and ensure it's recognized by your system.

Usage
Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect raw images:

python src/data/collection.py
Preprocess the collected images:

python src/run_preprocessing.py
Model Training
Configure the model parameters in configs/model_config.yaml.

Run the training script:

python src/run_training.py
Defect Detection
Start the Smart Scope application:

python src/ui/main.py
Use the UI to capture images and perform real-time defect detection.

Development Timeline
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Setup and Data Processing
Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Model Development
Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Integration and Testing
