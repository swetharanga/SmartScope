Smart Scope

An Object Detection Model for Identifying Defects in Electrical Components


The project will deliver a user-friendly interface that allows operators to control the inspection process, view defect information in real time, and save labeled images for quality audits. SmartScope will support detection across various electronic component types and include features such as automated calibration and quick setup (less than 15 minutes). By leveraging AI and high-resolution microscopy, this system has the potential to significantly reduce defect rates, improve production efficiency, and meet the evolving needs of the electronics manufacturing industry.
