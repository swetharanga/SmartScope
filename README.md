# Smart Scope: Object Detection Model

## Project Overview
Smart Scope is an advanced defect detection system designed to identify and classify defects in electronic components using computer vision and deep learning techniques. This project aims to improve quality control processes in manufacturing by automating the detection of defects in PCBs, LEDs, and other electronic components.

## Features
- High-resolution image capture using USB microscope
- Preprocessing pipeline for image standardization and quality control
- Deep learning model based on EfficientNetB0 for defect classification
- Real-time defect detection and visualization
- User-friendly interface for system interaction and result display
